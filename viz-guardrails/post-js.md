## Visualization Guardrails

You may have noticed that the interactive visualization looked different between different tasks.

In the image below, you can see a simple interface (at the top) and a **guardrail interface** (at the bottom).


***Simple interface:***
<img src='./images/example-n.png' width='500'>

***Guardrail interface:***
<img src='./images/example-js.png' width='500'>


Notice that the guardrail version of the visualization *shows the range of values for all the data on the side*.

## Questions
