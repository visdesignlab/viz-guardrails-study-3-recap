# Consent and Authorization Document

We are inviting you to take part in a research study. Please read the entire consent form in addition to this summary, 
ask questions, and take time to understand the study before you make any decision.

#### Purpose of the Study
Data exploration and visualization platforms are increasingly
common online. The purpose of this study is to learn
more about how people select data in visualizations and use them for communicating ideas.

#### Tasks
The study contains 4 tasks about 2 data sets as well as short follow-up surveys. 
It will take approximately 15-20 minutes to finish this test. 
For each question, you will be given a prompt with an interactive data
visualization. 
You will then be asked to select items from available data to produce a visualization that supports the prompt.
You will also be asked to accompany your selection with a short caption explaining your selection.
After each task, you will see a short survey asking about your experience performing the task.
We suggest maximizing your browser window as some charts can be on the larger side.
