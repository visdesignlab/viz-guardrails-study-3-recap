## Visualization Guardrails

You may have noticed that the interactive visualization looked different between different tasks.

In the image below, you can see a simple interface (at the top) and a **guardrail interface** (at the bottom).


***Simple interface:***
<img src='./images/example-n.png' width='500'>

***Guardrail interface:***
<img src='./images/example-sd.png' width='500'>


Notice that the guardrail version of the visualization *automatically shows all items from the selected groups*.

## Questions

Please answer the questions below about your experience completing the tasks *with* and *without* the guardrail enabled.
