## Instructions for the "Financial Advisor" Scenario 

This scenario consists of **2 tasks**.
If you need to refer to these instructions during the experiment, please click on help in the top right corner of the visualization.

**Scenario**: You are a financial advisor. Your client approached you asking for help in
picking a new investment&mdash;an industry fund that equally invests within a single industry. 
The client prefers to make their decisions *solely based on the data*, and not based on
any inside knowledge about the type of industry.
However, your boss *does* have inside knowledge and orders you to recommend a specific industry
(which is ultimately in the best interest of the client).
You cannot disclose this to the client and have to use data to support your recommendations.

**Task**: In the experiment, you will use an interactive data explorer that shows performance
of different stocks from a variety of industries. 
You should select a view that best shows (and convinces your client) that **the chosen 
industry fund would be the best investment with the highest returns**. After finalizing the view, 
add a caption or a slogan that will go along with your visualization.
