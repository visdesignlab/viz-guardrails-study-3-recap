## Visualization Guardrails

You may have noticed that the interactive visualization looked different between different tasks.

In the image below, you can see a simple interface (at the top) and a **guardrail interface** (at the bottom).

<img src='./images/example-n.png' width='500'>
<img src='./images/example-ss.png' width='500'>

Notice that the guardrail version of the visualization *also shows the average value of all the data, and the area where 50% of the data falls*.

## Questions

Please answer the questions below about your experience completing the tasks *with* and *without* the guardrail enabled.
