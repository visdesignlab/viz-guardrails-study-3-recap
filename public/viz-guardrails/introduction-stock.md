Welcome to the "Financial Advisor" Scenario. It consists of **2 tasks**.

## Instructions for the "Financial Advisor" Scenario 

The following instructions describe the tasks pertaining to this scenario. If you need to refer 
to these instructions during the experiment, please click on help at the top of the page.

**Scenario**: You are a financial advisor. Your client approached you asking for help in
picking a new investment---an industry fund that equally invests within a single industry. 
The client prefers to make their decisions *solely based on the data*, and not based on
any inside knowledge about the type of industry.
However, your boss *does* have inside knowledge and orders you to recommend a specific industry.
You cannot disclose this to the client and have to use data to support your orders.

**Task**: In the experiment, you will use an interactive data explorer that shows performance
of different stocks from a variety of industries. 
You should select a view that best shows (and convinces your client) that **the chosen 
industry fund would be the best investment with the highest returns**. After finalizing the view, 
click the camera button and add a caption or a slogan that will go along with your visualization.
