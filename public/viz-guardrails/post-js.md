## Visualization Guardrails

You may have noticed that the interactive visualization looked different between different tasks.

In the image below, you can see a simple interface (at the top) and a **guardrail interface** (at the bottom).


***Simple interface:***

***Guardrail interface:***

Notice that the guardrail version of the visualization *shows the range of values for all the data on the side*.
