## Title of Research Study: Communicating With Interactive Data Visualizations.
## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you
              agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of
              the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks
              or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your
              participation. This form presents information about the study so
              that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your
              participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly
common in everyday life. The purpose of this study is to learn
more about how people read and understand visualizations.

## Tasks
It will take approximately 7 minutes to finish this test. 
You will be shown a series of 5 data visualizations accompanied by short captions.
Your task is to answer a short survey about each visualization, indicating your opinion on how effective they are.
We suggest maximizing your browser window as some charts can be on the larger side.

## Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such,
your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will
not be used to identify you.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data
visualization, along with helping inform the
development of future experiment reporting techniques.

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held
confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study
investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain
circumstances, the University of Utah Institutional
Review Board (U of U IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to
this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not
identify you.

## Audio Recording

As part of this study, we will record your audio, and ask you to verbalize your thought process as you go through the study. All audio will be recorded, saved, and transcribed for later use. 

## Cost/Payment
Please check the Prolific description.

experimental procedures at any time they see fit.


## Data banking 

## Future Use of Private Information

As part of this study, we would like to keep information collected in during this project so that researchers may use it in the future in other research projects. When we use the term “data repository”, it refers to the storage of the information that is collected.

## What will be kept? 

We would like to keep recorded audio while you take this study, as well as interaction log data.

## What will my information be used for?

Information collected about you may be used for future research about data visualization to help us learn more.

## Who will keep my information?

Your information will be kept by Dr. Alexander Lex who manages the data repository at the University of Utah.

## Do I have to allow my information to be saved for future research?

If you do not want your information to be saved for future research, you should not participate in this study.

## Will my information be personally identifiable?

That information kept from you will not have your name or other personal information linked to it.  Your de-identified information may be shared with researchers at the University of Utah and at other institutions without additional informed consent from you or your legally authorized representative. The only information we will keep is information like your age. 

## What if I want to withdraw my information from the data repository?

Because we will not keep your name or other identifying information when we store your data, you will not be able to have your information removed from the data repository later. 

## Will my information be used for commercial profit? 

Information obtained from you in this research may help in the development of a commercial product by University of Utah or its research partners.  There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this occur.

## Will future results or findings be given to me?

Because your information cannot be linked back to you, we will not share the results from future studies with you.
